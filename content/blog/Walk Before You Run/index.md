## How comfortable are you with the data structures you use?

My mentor, a professional C++ Engineer, always asks me to build data structures repeatedly. Often back to back.

While he could give me leet-code-style coding challenges, he thinks becoming extremely comfortable with data structures is more important in the early stages.

I tend to agree. The more I build data structures, the more quickly I can solve problems with them.

## Where to start

There are many great Youtube videos on data structures and several online courses.

here are a few of my favorites

- [DATA STRUCTURES you MUST know (as a Software Developer)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVxBVvlnJsM)
- [Algorithms and Data Structures Tutorial - Full Course for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hly31xKli0)
- [Stacks & Queues | Data Structures in JavaScript](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AJ4ldcH2t4)

I also find typing "data structure you are learning" + "coding language" highly effective.

I would also love for you to try completing my one-week data structures challenge!
