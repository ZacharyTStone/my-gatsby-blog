Maybe you're in a similiar situation...Maybe not.

Either way, I hope you enjoy reading about my study process using free resources

### What I did

I read Elqouent Javascript in the morning with my coffee, highlighting and working through the exercises up to chapter 6.

I completed the entire intro to JS course about one unit per day (pro is free for 7 days if you want to do the quizes/'projects')

I completed the entire Full stack free bootcamp prep course. I found the videos great and completed ~all~ ... ~most~ ... some of the example problems.

I did 1-3 codewars problems everyday at level 7/8

and...

## I got in

At the end of the day, there are many other great resources like [freeCodeCamp ](http://example.com).

But try not to get lost in finding the perfect resource.

just focus on

**one line at a time.**

You got this....üëç
